Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a calculator application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my proficiency in web development and my ability to create functional and user-friendly interfaces.

Utilizing HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, this calculator offers a seamless and intuitive user experience. Whether it's basic arithmetic or more complex calculations, this calculator is designed to meet your mathematical needs.

I've incorporated modern design principles to ensure the calculator is visually appealing while maintaining usability across different devices and screen sizes.

Feel free to explore the codebase, provide feedback, or fork the repository to customize the calculator according to your preferences. I'm excited to share this project with you and hope it serves as a valuable resource for learning and inspiration in the world of web development.
